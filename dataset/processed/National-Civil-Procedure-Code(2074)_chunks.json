On the one hand the civil law provisions in the Country Code are extremely primitive, while on the other, the modern principles of civil law have been s cattered in other Nepal laws as the Code could not accommodate those pr inciples.

Since the principles of civil law enshrined in the prevaili ng laws could not respond to the necessity and requirements of the op en, liberal and democratic system of governance of the 21 st century, therefore, the need of formulating a separate Civil Code amending and consolidating the provisions of civil law was felt long time back. The country ushered in republican form of government after the election to the Constituent Assembly in 2008 as a result of the historic second people’s movement. In order to reform and modernize the existing civil law of the country according to the existing economic, social and cultural situation according to the spirit of republic and to prepare the drafts of Civil Co de and Civil Procedures Code, Government of Nepal (Council of Mi nisters) had formed a civil law reform and consolidation task for ce on December 3, 2008 under the convenorship of Mr. Khilaraj",

I am happy to publish and share with general public these drafts. It is my sincere belief that if the drafts, which have been prepared by the task force with deep study, wide discussions and massive consultation with the relevant stak eholders, could take the form of Acts, there would be signifi cant breakthrough in civil law administration of the country.

    "evening and public holidays. Kathmandu, October 7, 2010. Sd. M i n i s t e r L a w a n d J u s t i c e Foreword Civil law is the charter of civil relationship of every country. It is the only instrument on the basis of which relationship between citizens is regulated and managed. Since day-to -day behavior and relationship of citizens are operated by principles of civil law, it is of utmost importance in the civil life. In 1853, the Country Code was firs t enacted having consolidated the then civil law principles and we are at the present situation with amendment to that Code from time -to-time. The provisions made in the Code are in the primitive stage and it is sure that they could not respond to the changing need of the time, the liberalized policy adopted by the country, provisions made in the international human rights instruments to which Nepa l is a party and the principles developed and recognized in interna tional arena in the field of civil law.

    "made in the international human rights instruments to which Nepa l is a party and the principles developed and recognized in interna tional arena in the field of civil law. In this context, it is a matter of national priority to reform and modernize the civil law of the country. There have been efforts in the past to reform civil law. However, the purpose of those efforts was not to integrate and codify entire civil law. Realizing this need, Government of Nepal (Council of Ministers) had formed a Taskforce under the convenorship of a Justice of the Supreme Court on the recommendation of the Judicial Council and prescribed the terms of refe rence of the Taskforce. The Taskforce has prepared the dr afts of Civil Code and Civil Procedures Code subject to the pres cribed terms of reference.

    "While performing its tasks, the Taskfor ce has prepared the drafts having studied, reviewed and analyzed the existing civil law, the principles laid down by the Suprem e Court, the provisions made in the treaties to which Nepal is a party, Nepal’s soci al and cultural characteristics, the Civil Codes of the countries which ha ve codified their civil laws (such as Japan, France, the Philippines, Italy), and the substantive and procedural laws of the neighboring countries. There may be debate as to whet her or not codification is the appropriate way of reforming and modernizing law. The task of managing the scattered provisions of law in one Act is itself a challenging job and it is possible only by way of codification. The process of codification of laws in Ne pal seems to be relevant as in the recent past, there has been a growing trend of codification even in the countries which did not have experien ce of codification in the past and codification of civil law by two of the South-East",
    "past, there has been a growing trend of codification even in the countries which did not have experien ce of codification in the past and codification of civil law by two of the South-East Asian countries (Vietnam and Cambodia) just a few ye ars ago. It is the belief of the Taskforce that with the implementa tion of the proposed two drafts, there will be qualitative reform on the civil law of Nepal and modern national legal system will be establis hed in the country through simple and comprehensive law. Drafting of law itself is a difficu lt, time-taking and technical work. The Taskforce is of the view that drafting of civil law which covers vast and wide areas of civic relationship is much more difficult and challenging. Though effort has been made in the drafts prepared by the Taskforce to give it a final to uch from conceptual as well as drafting point of view, it is not that there may not be any room for further improvement.

Law reform is a perennial process an d it would attract in cases of the proposed codes.

The principles of civil law are being practiced since the very beginning of human civilization and th ey are in practice even today in their modified forms in various legal systems.

However, some of the principles of the civil law of Nepal are bein g directed by the jurisprudential principles of civil law and principl es laid down by the Supreme Court rather than by legislation enacted by the legislature. In the context of the open and market-oriented economy, the obligations arising out of international treaties to which Nepal is a party and the development of liberal and democratic society, seve ral principles of the existing civil law have already been in complete and irrelevant. To speak truly, there is lack of proper laws on so ma ny subjects of civil law in Nepal.

As a part of this endeavor, preparation is underway to formulate drafts of Civil Code and Civil Procedures Code and to introduce them in Legislature-Parliament in the form of Bills. As the country has been passing thro ugh a transitional phase, it might be argued that law reform is not a necessity at this difficult stage.

Reasons for Reforming civil law: Legal system of Nepal, particular ly, civil law system of Nepal is in very primitive stage.

    "developed in other countries co uld not have got any space in Nepal law. There have been signifi cant changes in political and social sectors in Nepal, but the scattered civil law provisions could not have addressed the need s of changes and open market economy. On the one hand, civil la w of the country is scattered in a traditional manner while on the other, so many of the legal provisions are not complete in themselves. As a result, so many of the important principles, valu es and provisions of civil law are confined only as the matters of academic discourse in our legal system. civil law is the backbo ne of strengthening of an open, liberal and market-oriented economy. It cannot be forgotten that in developed countries, civil law has promoted market economy. As the society has been movi ng towards modernity from traditional system, it is necessary to codify and modernize civil law accordingly.

Because of the liberal economic system the country has adopted, it is the high time for us to modernize and reform civil law also to respo nd to the needs of collaboration and transactions with other coun tries. Nepal has to start the journey of codification of laws ha ving regard to the facts that the countries which were not in favour of codification traditionally have codifying their laws. It is in this background that Government of Nepal has pursued the policy of reforming civil law of Nepal by enacting Ci vil Code and Civil Procedures Code. Codification of law means inclusio n in a single legislation the legal principles, values and provis ions in a particular area (such as civil, criminal law and so on) in a well-managed order and to enforce them.

From the process of codification, not only the laws will be codified, they will be simple, easily understandable and logical and it would contribu te in making a complete law. With reference to civil law, co dification is required for the following reasons:- (1) Since civil law is the charter of civic relationship in any society and since it has the ownership of citizen, it is desirable to have included all general principles of civil law in one Code to the extent possible; (2) Civil law contributes in de velopment of jurisprudence of the nation which enriches national law, thus, it is necessary to have separate Code on civil matters; (3) Not only the making of Civil Code will modernize our legal system, it will also re spond to the open market policies adopted by other countries, thus, Civil Code is required; (4) Civil Code could be developed as a means of promoting national integrity as having a uniform Civil",

Purposes of the Civil Code: Making of and amendment to law is an inseparable part of social development process. The Civil Co de and Civil Procedures Code have to be taken as tools of pr omoting national integration, as means of developing Nepale se jurisprudence, and as cornerstones of modernization of law in Nepal. Since civil law uses to have a very close relatio nship with living style of every citizen of a country, this is calle d as the citizen’s charter and it is one of the major tools of so lving day-to-day problems of people in general. It is believe d that the proposed Codes, which have been prepared with inclus ion of scattered principles and provisions of civil la ws along with those not yet developed",
    "problems of people in general. It is believe d that the proposed Codes, which have been prepared with inclus ion of scattered principles and provisions of civil la ws along with those not yet developed in the country, would play a signifi cant role in responding to the ever increasing needs of managing legal relationships in society thereby massively managing ci vic obligation and protecting rights and interests of general people. 6. Proposed legal provisions , their bases and drafting methodology of the Civil Code and Civil Procedures Code: 6.1 The prevailing Country Code and other laws on relevant subjects have been taken as the main bases of the proposed Civil Code and Civil Procedures Co de. The legal principles the country has practiced over the la st one hundred and fifty years in the area of civil law have b een given room in both of the Codes either as they are or in their improved forms.

Necessary provisions of civil law have been proposed in both Codes having regard to our geographical, et hnic, religious and cultural diversity. Also an effort has been made to include the principles and precedents laid down and by the Supreme Court from time to time and being recognized and used in the field of civil law like legal provisions. The legal principles recognized in the jurisprudence of the country but having no legal provisions to backup them (such as principl es relating to persons) are responded to along with concepts and required legal provisions. Similarly, the concepts which ha ve been clearly recognized in our laws but not in practice (such as trusts or Guthee ) have been proposed as new legal provisio ns with timely changes and reforms. 6.2 While preparing the proposed Civil Code and Civil Procedures Code, Civil Codes in various countries have also been studied.

Since the codificatio n of civil law is mainly the product of continental legal system, the Taskforce has taken into account of the Codes prevailin g in the countries which have been adopting the same legal syst em such as France, Germany, Japan, the Philippines and Quebec province in Canada. However, the provisions contained in thos e Codes could not be borrowed and implemented as such having regard to special social, economic and cultural traditions in our country. Despite of this fact, in Nepal, there is the lack of so many of significant civil law provisions prevailing and pract iced in countries having the history of codification for the la st two hundred years (such as France) and if such provisions could be introduced in our country with special reference of our context, it would enrich",

Therefore, some of such provisions have been proposed. 6.3 Some of the legal principles of civil law which have been in practice in Nepal without any written and elaborative legal provisions to back th em have been given space in the Civil Code and elaborated. Such provisions includes provisions relating to maternal and paternal authority , guardianship, curatorship, leasing contracts, hire and purc hase contracts, servitude which are in seldom use in Nepal wit hout adequate legal provisions and having regard to the same, provisions have been made in detail in the Civil Code to prov ide adequate backup for them.

Until now, the matters relating to inter-country adoption are being governed by the Countr y Code Chapter on Adoption and the Terms and Procedures framed by Government of Nepal, under the powers made in the Co untry Code. Having regard to this fact, the provisions concer ning inter-country adoption have to be made as part of substantia l law in the proposed Civil Code specially in the context where Nepa l is going to be a party to the Hague Convention on Inter-Coun try Adoption. In addition to this, an effort has been made to include in these Codes the provisions made in the treaties to which Nepal is a party (specially related to human rights ) in such a manner that they may not be inconsistent with the provisions hade in such human rights instruments.

Moreover, some of the fundamental principles of civil law which have been introduced and in practice in other countries but not provided for in law of Nepal (such as usufruct, testamentary will and other will, parents and children re lationship, unjust enrichment and so on) have been dealt with in separate Chapter each. 6.4 So far as the Civil Procedures Code is concerned, the proposed draft contains the pro cedures of civil cases prevailing in the country in a logical order.

From the procedural point of view, some new provisions have been introduced in the Code about which detail elaboration ha s been made in Paragraph 8 below. 6.5 While drafting the Civil Code and Civil Procedures Code, our existing drafting style and methodology based on common law system have been followed. Separate matters of civil law have been presented in separate chapters treating each of them as a branch of civil law. The ch apters have been chosen based on the need of each of the subject-matters. In each of the chapters, sections and sub-sectio ns have been given as may be necessary. 7.

The proposed Code consists of following subject-matte rs in the following six parts, 52 chapters and 751 sections. If the Code is passed by the Legislature-Parliament and authen ticated in its present form, it is sure that it will be the longest ever Act in the country.

The provisions of this Code have been treated as general law and it is provided that if there is any special law on any specific subjectmatter, the provisions of the special law shall prevail on such matters and this Code will not affect on such provisions. Like general principles of criminal justice in jurisprudence, the universally accepted principles of civil law and principles determined by the Supreme Court in Nepal have been dealt with in a separate Chapter as general principles of civil law. This Chapter deals with the some prevailing general princi ples of civil law such as ignorance of law not to be an excuse, wrongdoer to bear damages, no benefit out of wrongdoing, civil liability not to be exempted and act agai nst law to be invalid.

There was a long de bate among members of the Taskforce as to whether or not to have the separate Chapter for civil rights and finally, it was settled by consensus based on the practice of some of the countries that it be dealt with as a separate Chapter.

The second part of the Ci vil Code deals with legal provisions relating to persons. There are three chapters in this part viz. natural person , legal person and bankruptcy of a natural person. Though law of person is not new in the Nepalese jurisprudence, how ever, the Code for the first time has proposed separate prov isions as laws of person. The legal capacity of natural pe rsons has been classified in three stages as full legal cap acity, partial legal capacity and incapacity. Though unso undness of mind has been frequently used in our legal context, no provisions have been made with regard to its definition and legal status. Under the provisions relating to legal person, new provisions have been proposed such as the conditions in which a legal person acquire s legal capacity, the works legal person is capable of doing, provisions relating to some entities",

Since there is separate Insolvency Act, 2006 in for ce with regard to corporate insolvency, this part deals only with bankruptcy of natural person alone. The third part of the Code comprises of different chapters on provisions relating to fa mily law. The principles of civil nature elaborated in the Chapters on Ma rriage and on Husband and Wife of the exis ting Country Code have been proposed in this part as th ree chapters viz.

Though some of the provisions proposed in the Code are prev ailing at present, however, those provisions are not time ly and having regard to directive orders issued by the Supreme Court on marriage and divorce, effort has been made to reform and improve those provisions with a view to maintain gender equality.

In the Chapter on curatorship, provision have been proposed that in case there is no guardian of any person, any one can be appointed as his/her curator and curator may hold and take care of property of such a person.

Because of influence of Hindu law, th ere is a provision that no person having a son may adop t a son and no person having a daughter may adopt a daught er. This traditional approach to adoption has been changed and it is proposed that if the concerned person is financially capable, a court may allow him/her to adopt a son even if he/she is having a son or daughter even if he/she is having a daughter. This provision has been propose d because the absolute traditional provision of proh ibiting adoption of a son if one is having a son and of a daughter if one is having a daughter may not be relevant in the present context. Similarly, the present provis ion of getting the deed of adoption registered at Land Revenue Office like any deed of property transaction has been proposed to be changed and it is proposed that such d eed has to be certified from District Court as it is a matte r relating to legal capacity of person rather",

In addition, a new provision has been propos ed that if the separated husband and wife start to live together again, the son or daughter adopted earlier by eith er of them shall belong to both of them. Normally, age of the person adopted as son or daughter should be below the age of fourteen years, however, it is proposed as ne w provision that within the relationship of three generations, the said age bar is not applicable so that even the matured person of old age could become an adopted son or adopted daughter.

In so many countries in the wo rld, there is no provision of partition of family property an d the owner of property may transfer the property to the person he/she wills. However, having regard to Nepal’s economic, social and cultural aspects, the existing provisio ns of partition of parental property is left continued. However, this provision leads the children to remain dependent to paternal property. This law is in practice in Nepal for centuries and it is seen to be a natural right of children.

Since the provision of taking costs for life maintenance (jiuni ) and expenses for marriage se em to be irrelevant and impracticable, it is proposed to repeal such provisions. The fourth part of the Code deals with law of property which contains 15 chapters an d such as provisions as to ownership of property, possession, definition and use of government, public and private property and the provisions which are in practice in Nepal either directly or indirectly but not being recogn ized conceptually such as usufruct, servitude, land cultivation and prescription, house rent, trusts, acquisition and transfer of property, mortgage of immovable proper ty, registration of",

A ccording to the newly emerged concept of property in the pr ocess of social development, the concept of community pr operty has been proposed. Provision of trust to allow property in one’s ownership and possession to be managed and operated for the benefits of the beneficiaries has been proposed. The current practice of trusts is pr oposed to be continued under the law of trust of common law system.

In this part, on the one hand, the existing laws on cont ract have been consolidated and inadequate provisions ha ve been improved while on the other, new concepts in our context such as unjust enrichment, torts, defective products liability have been incorporated.

So many of the countries such as France, Spain, Switzerland, Japan are having separate comm ercial Code while there is only one civil and commercial Code in the Netherlands. The Chapter on lease invest ment which is in the preliminary stage of draft ha s been excluded from this Code and it is recommended to incorporate it in commercial Code or to enact a separate law for it.

The private international law mainly deals with conflicts of law and such disputes are mainly related to civil law ma tters. As this concept is law is at the infancy stage in Nepal, it is proposed to incorporate such provisions in a separate Chapter in the Civil Code. 8. The New Legal Principles prop osed in the Civil Code and its bases and causes: The following new provisions intr oduced in the existing civil law and those improved in the existing law are as follows:- 8.1 New Provision to Presumptio n of Death of a Person: As the current law provision (Section 32 of the Evidence Act, 1974) of regarding the pe rson disappeared for the last twelve years without notice to be dead normally seems to be appropriate, it is proposed to be continued. However, if this twelve years clause is made applicable even with regard to the extremely old pe rson or a person deputed to a war zone or person",
    "be appropriate, it is proposed to be continued. However, if this twelve years clause is made applicable even with regard to the extremely old pe rson or a person deputed to a war zone or person met with an accident, it would be not rational. Thus, the Taskforce has proposed new provision in this regard having studied such provisions in other countries. Since the averag e maximum age of a person is not more than 100 years, it would not be appropriate to presume that if a person of 95 years disappears, he/she would be presumed to be d ead only after 12 years. Similarly, if there is a clear evidence that a person is deputed to a war zone or he/s he has met with an accident, it would not be appropriate to presume such person to be dead only after a lo ng period of 12 years. Therefore, new provision has been proposed that if no normal information is received with regard to a disappeared person who is of 80 years or more or who is deputed to a war zone or who has met with an accident is not",
    "proposed that if no normal information is received with regard to a disappeared person who is of 80 years or more or who is deputed to a war zone or who has met with an accident is not surviving for a period of five years, four years and three years respectively, the person so disappeared will be presumed to be dead. 8.2 Detail provision as to legal person: Though the concept of lega l person is not new in jurisprudence, there is no provision in general law as to the status of legal person. W ith regard to legal person, a new Chapter has been made providing that legal personality will be acquired on ly after getting registered with a competent authority an d after registration; such person will acquire corporat e personality. In addition, matters as to acquisition and exercise of rights by such authorities, decision-making authority within them and consequences of thei r dissolution have also been made in the proposed Code. 8.3 New Concept in Bankruptcy law: According to the prevailing",
    "exercise of rights by such authorities, decision-making authority within them and consequences of thei r dissolution have also been made in the proposed Code. 8.3 New Concept in Bankruptcy law: According to the prevailing law on bankruptcy, it is not clear how long will the status of bankruptcy of a person declared to be bankrupt last. Since this non-clarity it must be supposed that a person d eclared to be bankrupt would remain bankrupt for an indefinite period of time. However, as this provision is not appr opriate from the human right point of view as well, it requ ires a fresh look for reform. Thus, it has been proposed that a person declared to be bankrupt from a court will last for a period of 12 years and after that period, he/she would be treated as if he/she is not declared bankrupt. 8.4 New provision in family law: Some new dimension in family law have been proposed in the Nepali jurisprudence. A ccording to the proposed provision, marriage registration is being gradually made",
    "not declared bankrupt. 8.4 New provision in family law: Some new dimension in family law have been proposed in the Nepali jurisprudence. A ccording to the proposed provision, marriage registration is being gradually made mandatory, new provision as to relationship between father, mother and children, paternal and maternal authority, and provision rela ting to guardianship and curatorship. Though these concepts are not new in Nepalese society, the legal provisions as such are new. 8.5 Provisions concerning testamentary will: The provision of will of one’s own title or ownership is not new concept in the Nepale se law. The deed of will with immediate effect ( halaiko bakas patra ) or deed of will to be effective after death ( sheshpachhiko bakas patra ) are the mechanism by whic h the system of will is being practiced to some exte nt. However, so long as the present provision of partitio n of parental property continues, deed of will with immediate effect or deed of will to be effective",
    "being practiced to some exte nt. However, so long as the present provision of partitio n of parental property continues, deed of will with immediate effect or deed of will to be effective after death could be implemented subject to the partition of property. So far as the question of provision relating to will sy stem is concerned, parental property or property acquired by a person has to be disposed of after death of such person according to the deed of will he/she has executed. According to traditional concept of will, if it is proved that a person has executed a deed of will; formal procedures concerning it are of least si gnificance. However, in the present time when honesty an d moral values are decaying, it would not be prudent to le ave the execution of deed of will open. Therefore, it is proposed that such a deed of will has to be certified by certain authority for its authenticity purpose, and for that Land Revenue Office, Embassy or Consulate general in abroad or a notary public",
    "is proposed that such a deed of will has to be certified by certain authority for its authenticity purpose, and for that Land Revenue Office, Embassy or Consulate general in abroad or a notary public are proposed as the entities to certify the execution of such deeds. 8.6 Provisions concerning Usufruct: The provision of getting benefit or advantage from somebody else’s property without transferring the ownership of such property is one of the major aspects of civil law and it is being practi ced to some extent in Nepal as well. However, as there is no legal and institutional arrangement made in Nepali ju risprudence in this regard, legal provision concerning us ufruct has been proposed. From this provision, movable or immovable property will be mobilized to the optimum extent that accelerates economic activities. Thus, this concept has special importance in a market economy. From provision of usufruct, any person may hand over property under his/her title and ownership to any one else",
    "accelerates economic activities. Thus, this concept has special importance in a market economy. From provision of usufruct, any person may hand over property under his/her title and ownership to any one else for certain period for prescription. It is the expect ation of the Taskforce that it will accelerate economic activities by way of optimum mobilization of property. 8.7 Provisions concerning servitude: Concept of servitude with reference to use of private property is not new in Nepalese society, though its use has been very narrowly confined . This does not cover the whole concept of servitude or easement prevailing in other countries. Having regard to the sane fact, the Taskforce has proposed to include in Nepali jurisprudence the concept of servitude in the use or prescription of immovable property and has pr oposed a sepa rate Chapter for its practical use. 8.8 Hire purchase contract and lease contracts: Though the Contract Act, 1999 had given a new dimension to the literature of",
    "has pr oposed a sepa rate Chapter for its practical use. 8.8 Hire purchase contract and lease contracts: Though the Contract Act, 1999 had given a new dimension to the literature of Nepali la w with regard to general and special provisions of contract, it could not have covered within it hire purchase contract and lease contract. Hire purchase contract is one of the major means of market economy under which the good s sold by a seller to the buyer is, until full payment of the goods so sold is paid, deemed to be let to the buye r by the seller and ownership of the goods will be transferre d to the buyer once the full price of the goods is paid. Though this provision is not there in the Nepali law, it is being governed by general previsions made in contract. Thus, a new Chapter has been proposed for this purpose. So far as provision of lease co ntract is concerned, this is letting immovable property for a long time and which is different from house rent. 8.9 Provisions concerning torts:",
    "has been proposed for this purpose. So far as provision of lease co ntract is concerned, this is letting immovable property for a long time and which is different from house rent. 8.9 Provisions concerning torts: Though there is no separate la w of torts in Nepal, however, it is not the case that there wa s no use of tortuous liability in Nepal. Requirement of paym ent of damages for loss of crops by cattle ( bali armal ) is one of such example. Nonetheless, there has been on formal use of the word tort in any Nepal law. Duskriti may not be the actual translation of the English word “tort.” Nevertheless, this word has been in the use in the Nepali legal field, the Taskforce has used the word Duscriti in its original form . 8.10 Provisions concerning Private International Law: Though transactions and relationship of Nepal and Nepali people with foreign countie s and foreign citizens and corporate bodies on various subj ects of civil nature are on the rise, there are no provisions relating",
    "Though transactions and relationship of Nepal and Nepali people with foreign countie s and foreign citizens and corporate bodies on various subj ects of civil nature are on the rise, there are no provisions relating to private international law in the Ne pal law to regulate such matters; therefore, a separate Chapter has been proposed in Part 6 of the proposed Civ il Code. Though the proposed provisions could not respond to all the subjects of private international law prevailing in international practice, basic essential principles have been proposed in this Chapter. One question may be raised as to need of incorporation of provisions of private interna tional law in the Civil Code itself. This is one important and relevant question of codification of law. There is no uniformity in other countries having codification of civil law. However, as the Civil Codes of Italy, of Russian Federation, of Vietnam and of the Quebec province of Canada are having a separate Chapter on private international",
    "having codification of civil law. However, as the Civil Codes of Italy, of Russian Federation, of Vietnam and of the Quebec province of Canada are having a separate Chapter on private international law, it is felt appropriate to incorporate it in the proposed Civil Code. 9. Civil Procedures Code: The Civil Procedures Code dete rmined the procedures to be followed for settlement of disputes of civil nature and it none of the significant aspects of civil law administration. Even in the countries not having separate Civil Code (such as India, Bangladesh, Pakistan) were having Civil Procedures Code since 1908 and the need was felt in Nepal as well long time back. Though efforts were made in the past also to draft Civil Procedures Code, there was no pub lication of an integrated draft prepared and published. Thus, it ha s to be taken as the first step in this regard. The proposed Code consists of 23 chapters, 290 sections and 30 schedules, the de tails of which are as follows:-",
    "Chapter-1 Preliminary 3 sections",
    "Chapter-2 General principles of Civil Procedures\n12 sections",
    "Chapter-3 Provisions concerning Jurisdiction 12 sections",
    "Chapter-4 Provisions concerning procedures\npreparation of documents\n19 sections",
    "Chapter-5 Provisions concerning limitation 16 sections",
    "Chapter-6 Provisions concerning court fees 22 sections",
    "Chapter-7 Provisions concerning statement of claims\nand claims\n14 sections",
    "Chapter-8 Provisions concerning summons and\nservice of summons\n20 sections",
    "Chapter-9 Provisions concerning statement of defense\nand counter claims\n7 sections",
    "Chapter-10 Provisions concerning endorsement 5 sections",
    "Chapter-11 Provisions concerning preliminary hearing 4 sections",
    "Chapter-12 Provisions concerning date for appearing in\ncourts\n14 sections",
    "Chapter-13 Provisions concerning power of attorneys 12 sections",
    "Chapter-14 Provisions concerning interlocutory or\ninterim order\n5 sections",
    "Chapter-15 Provisions concerning examination of\ndocumentary evidences\n18 sections",

The main provisions proposed in this Code and the ratio nale behind them are as follows:- 9.1 Coverage of procedures: The proposed procedures code ha s been designed in such a way that both judicial and quasi-judi cial authorities to try cases of civil nature may invoke it. Accordingly, the words like court and judge have been defined. 9.2 Nature of the Code: This procedures code has been proposed as General Code of procedures. If there is a separa te civil procedures are provided in the prevailing law, it shall be according to that law and in other matters it shall be according to this Code. 9.3 Clear demarcation of civil and criminal",
    "civil procedures are provided in the prevailing law, it shall be according to that law and in other matters it shall be according to this Code. 9.3 Clear demarcation of civil and criminal cases: Though No. 9 of the existing Coun try Code has classified civil and criminal cases, its use has raised some non-clarity in practice and some of the civil na ture cases are being registered in criminal record. Clear demarca tion has been made to end this anomaly. This would end the curr ent trend of registering civil nature cases such as divor ce in the criminal record. 9.4 General principles of civil procedures In Chapter 2 of the proposed Code, some of the general principles of civil procedures have been identified and mandatory provision of complianc e of these principles in the proceedings of cases of civil nature by judicial and quasijudicial authorities. It has been expected that these provisions will facilitate even the quasi-judi cial bodies to hear and decide cases. Most of the principles",

It has been expected that these provisions will facilitate even the quasi-judi cial bodies to hear and decide cases. Most of the principles elaborat ed here are, normally, in our practice but some of them are new provisions proposed. Among the proposed principles, all pa rties to a dispute in a court including Government of Nepal ha ve to be treated equally and they will have the same capacity. However, if a separate law has afforded special treatment or di scount to Government of Nepal or any other person (such as in case of court fee, locus standi and so on), it shall be accordingly. Similarly, it is proposed that a civil case may be compromised at any stage or any court and that one level appeal is a matter of right. 9.5 Court fee The procedures code includes pr ovision to clarify jurisdiction, limitation and court fee which are vital subjects of administration of justice.

The pr ovision made in the existing Court Fees Act, 1960 have been modified according to necessity and the English words used in the Act have been converted into Nepali language as Adalati shulka . 9.6 New provision of co unter claim and defendant: The existing scattered provisions relating to statement of claims and statement of defense have been included in one Act and proposed to make them simple . In addition, the following new previsions are also made:- (a) The current law of filing an other statement of claims to make any new claims while filing statement of defense against the claim made in the statement of claims has been modified and it is prop osed as new provision that counter-claims may be made in the statement of defense itself. In such situation, the defendant must pay court fee according to the amount",
    "been modified and it is prop osed as new provision that counter-claims may be made in the statement of defense itself. In such situation, the defendant must pay court fee according to the amount claime d in such c ounter-claims. (b) Though there is legal provis ion at present in No. 139 of the Chapter on Court Proceedi ngs, the Country Code that a court may hear the person who is not made as party to a case but who has been implicated in the case or compliant and he/she may be made a party to the case. But a person who is not imp licated in case could not be made a party. This law is proposed to be changed and propose that though not impli cated in a case, if right, interests, claim or concern of a person are related in a case, if the concerned person makes a request for it if the court finds it appropriate, such a person may be made as a party to such a case. 9.7 Provisions concerning preliminary hearing According to the existing law, ev en if the defendant has made claims that the plaintiff",
    "court finds it appropriate, such a person may be made as a party to such a case. 9.7 Provisions concerning preliminary hearing According to the existing law, ev en if the defendant has made claims that the plaintiff has no locus standi , that the statement of claims is not filed within the li mitation, or that the court in which the case has been filed has no jurisdiction to try such a case, these preliminary questions are not settled first and the case-proceedings go on and finally , the cases are decided based on these preliminary cases afte r so many years. If such provisions are not im proved, effectiveness of court proceedings may be questioned and it would pr omote vexatious litigation. In order to reform this situation, it is proposed that court must settle this question before exam ining evidences and preliminary hearing should be conducted for that purpose.

    "question before exam ining evidences and preliminary hearing should be conducted for that purpose. It is proposed that through preliminary hearing, the statement of claims will be dismissed if there is no jurisdiction, locus standi or limitation. 9.8 New provisions concer ning submitting copy of statement of claims and service of summons: In the proposed Code , the existing provisions with regard to service of summons have been continued with necessary modifications. The proposed new provision in this regard is that if the plaintiff himself/herself de sires to deliver the statement of claims along with summons of the court, he/she may deliver them and in the case of legal persons, the plaintiff himself/herself has to deliver the summons. Since this provision has been already introduced in the Arbitration Act, 1999, it could be made applicable to all suits of civil nature. Moreover, it is also proposed that the summ on in name of the officials, legal practitioners, witnesses, powe r of",

It is causing delay in h earing and settlement of cases. The existing provision was made in the specific cont ext of lacking communication and transportation facilities in the distant past and as there has been remarkab le progress in communication and transport, the provision of ex tension",
    "existing provision was made in the specific cont ext of lacking communication and transportation facilities in the distant past and as there has been remarkab le progress in communication and transport, the provision of ex tension of time limit for three times not exceeding 30 days in tota l is not justifiable. As this provision requires a review, it is proposed that time-limit may be expanded up to a period of 21 days for two times only. 9.10 Use of video conference may be allowed: It is proposed in the procedures code that in case a party submits an application requesting to ex amine a witness who could not appear at the court for any special reason through video conference, the witness examination may be conducted through video conference. 9.11 Provisions concerning mutual legal assistance: Though No. 34 of the Chapter on Court Proceedings, the Country Code provides that service in abroad of summons, notice or closed-questions issued by courts of Nepal and service in Nepal of summons,",
    "Though No. 34 of the Chapter on Court Proceedings, the Country Code provides that service in abroad of summons, notice or closed-questions issued by courts of Nepal and service in Nepal of summons, notice or closed-questions issued by a foreign court shall be according to Rules made by Government of Nepal, however, no such Rules could have been framed so far, and that particular Number ha s not been implemented. Since Nepal’s transactions with foreign countries is on the rise day-byday and since a large number of Nepali people have been living abroad, it is necessary to have legal provisions for service of summons used by courts in Nepa l in abroad, witnesses to be examined and judgments delivered in abroad to be executed in Nepal, therefore, some legal prov isions have been made for the same purpose.

Judgments of courts will be meaningless if they are not en forced on time. Unless and until judgments are enforced in a simp le and easy manner, people in general could not feel to get jus tice. The ultimate realization of effectiveness of a decision or fi nal order of a court is possible only through execution of judgm ent.

    "a court is possible only through execution of judgm ent. As the Taskforce was of the view that execution of judgme nt in simple, easy and speedy manner itself is a realization of justice and the procedures relating to execution of justice have to be dealt with in the Civil Procedures, the Taskforce has pr epared the draft taking into special account of creation of machinery for execution of judgments. In order to execut e judgments in simple, easy and speedy manner, it is proposed that after preparation of judgment, the court should send the re cord thereof to the Judgment Execution Section immediately and a separate case-file and record of judgment has to be sent to the concerned District Court for execution. In order to avoid delay in ex ecution of judgment after the verdict and in order to execute judgment by way of compromise or reconciliation, new procedures have been proposed so that parties to a case may get the judgment executed by making a joint petition to the court for that",

There is no limitation fixed to file a suit fo r partition of property. However, in case of effecting the partition, a long period of three years is prescribed. The Supreme Court ha s also interpreted that if no petition is filed within the said time, partition need not be effected. Clause (4) of Article 20 of the Interim Constitution of Nepal provides that a son and a daughter shall have equal right in partition of property and a gettin g a share from partition of family property has been accepte d as one of the natural rights and a right at birth. It is the vi ew of",
    "in partition of property and a gettin g a share from partition of family property has been accepte d as one of the natural rights and a right at birth. It is the vi ew of the Taskforce that so long as the provision of partition of fa mily property continues, on one should be deprived from a share of property through any technical basis. In the context of difficulties faced by courts in executing judgments in partition of property cases and having regard to the increasing flow of such cases in courts, the Taskforce has proposed that if the parties to a suit for partition of property are on due date to appear at the court, the judgment shall be executed within three months. If there are more than one coparceneres and one of the co-parceners does not present at the court, a 15-day notice shall be sent to him/her and if all coparceners present, partition of pr operty shall be effected then and there. Similarly, if not all co-parcener s present at the court, it is proposed that the court shall",
    "be sent to him/her and if all coparceners present, partition of pr operty shall be effected then and there. Similarly, if not all co-parcener s present at the court, it is proposed that the court shall separate the share of partition property of the person who is not present at the court. It is also proposed that if the statement of property at the time of partition is not exact, the value of the shortfall property shall be determined and it shall be reimbu rsed from the property of the person providing the share of property or the person taking custody of the property. 9.14 Guardian may with permission of court file a case: It is proposed that in order to pr otect rights of the person who is a minor according to the law, old, blind or incapable of speaking, or having unsound mind , the guardian may fi le a suit or submit statement of defense, appeal or a petition on behalf of such a person with an approval of the co urt.

This would relieve courts from unnecessary backlog of case s and people will get justice on time. 10. Suggestions concerning policy and institutiona l reform to be made in civil law: Though necessary provisions have been proposed in the Civil Code and Civil Procedures Code for reform in the existing laws, however, the following recomme ndations have been made for strengthening civil law by e ffective implementation of the proposed Codes:- (1) As per the practice until now, the Nepal law has not accepted the requirement of registration of marriage as a mandatory act as provided in civil laws of other countries. If the act of registration of marriage has to be left as a voluntary act, the act of get ting marriage concluded will be a never-ending job. According to para (2) of Article 16 of the Convention on the E limination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women,",
    "voluntary act, the act of get ting marriage concluded will be a never-ending job. According to para (2) of Article 16 of the Convention on the E limination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, 1979, to which Nepal is a party, it is mandatory to re gister every marriage in a register to be maintained fo r that purpose. In order to implement this provision as we ll, registration of marriage must be made mandatory in our country. Therefore, it is proposed in the Co de that in whatsoever manner may a marriage be solemnized, su ch marriage has to be registered in order to get le gal validity. In order to fully implement this provision, Government of Nepal should raise public awareness mass ively through mass media and local bodies and civil societ y should also develop the marriage registration system as a necessary condition of matrimonial life. It is the expectation of the Taskforce that it would further promote the legal status of women. It is also recommended to make necessary",
    "marriage registration system as a necessary condition of matrimonial life. It is the expectation of the Taskforce that it would further promote the legal status of women. It is also recommended to make necessary legal provision that a non-registered marriage w ill not have legal validity by being a party to the Conventio n on Consent to Marriage, Minimum Age to Marriage and Registration of Marriage, 1965. (2) The Chapter on lease inve stment which was in the Civil Code published in 2006 has been excluded from the proposed Code. It is the view of the Taskforce that time has not been mature d enough for the concept of lease investment, which is distinct from day-to-day matter of civic relationship, to be includ ed in the civil law. However, it is not the view of the Taskfo rce that there is no need of lease investment law in the c ountry. The Taskforce is of the view that such a law must be incorporated in bank and financial institutions law rather than in the Civil Code. (3) According to",
    "lease investment law in the c ountry. The Taskforce is of the view that such a law must be incorporated in bank and financial institutions law rather than in the Civil Code. (3) According to suggestio ns received from regional consultation meetings held in various regions and national consultation, the provisions concerning partition of property have been reviewed and provisions to transfer property through will system ha s been proposed . Though it is easy to make laws relating to will, it is very difficult to move society forward from the centuries old tradition of sons and daughters to have ri ghts in shares of family property from father or husband through partition of property. In a society like ou r where education is not wellavailable and opportunities of employment are very minimal, it would be difficult for people to earn a means of livelihood if a share of pr operty is not received from father or husband. Irrespective of that fact, it is necessary to relieve society from the",
    "difficult for people to earn a means of livelihood if a share of pr operty is not received from father or husband. Irrespective of that fact, it is necessary to relieve society from the trad itional principle of partition of property and to allow people to dispose of their property according to thei r will thereby changing the traditional style of being depe ndent on paternal property. This has to be started from a particular point of time. Thus, the Taskforce has proposed that this system be introduced with effect from the 1 st of Baisakh, 2080 (corresponding to April 13, 2023). To materiali ze this provision the state should provide free and compulsory and vocational education, create more and more opportunities of employment, and make people to rely more on hard-work and labour. We recommend to Government of Nepal to take measures in this regard. 4) Once the two Codes are brought into force, it is sure that new dimension will begin in Nepal but as the courts will have extra functions",
    "Nepal to take measures in this regard. 4) Once the two Codes are brought into force, it is sure that new dimension will begin in Nepal but as the courts will have extra functions to carry on (marriage registration, appointment of guardians and curators and registration of deeds of adoption), the existing number of staff of District Court and budget will be in sufficient. If there is no efficient human resources in ju diciary, it could hardly be expected that even a good law may deliver good results. Therefore, the existing staffing of courts must be reviewed, judges and support staff must be trained and physical capacity must be enhanced such as audio-visual aids. 5) As the current trends show , the condition of judgment execution is not satisfactory. If judgments of courts are not enforced on time, it will be meaningless. Unless and until judgments are enforced in a simple and easy manner, people in general could not feel to get justice.

    "it will be meaningless. Unless and until judgments are enforced in a simple and easy manner, people in general could not feel to get justice. Taking into account of this fact, this Code has proposed some new procedures. In order to im plement this provision in practice, the Taskforce recomm ends Government of Nepal to establish a mechanism comprising of experienced and appropriate human resources. 6) It is already stated that ci vil law is a matter of concern and interest for general people, it mu st be revised from time to time. Law will be develope d and people will feel ownership of the policies adopted by the state only if civil laws are reformed according to the policies adopted by the state. Therefore, it is recommended to Government of Nepal to form a Taskforce to review the whole civil law of the country with a view to bringing timely changes in them.
